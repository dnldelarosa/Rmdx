## Installation

Rmdx is not yet in CRAN.

<!-- You can install the released version of Rmdx from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->

<!-- install.packages("Rmdx") -->

<!-- ``` -->

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
tryCatch(
  library(devtools),
  error = function(e){
    install.packages('devtools')
  }
)
devtools::install_github("drdsdaniel/Rmdx")
```

## Usage

If you are using RStudio, you can create a new Rmdx document from file
menu: `File -> New file -> R Markdown -> From Template`.

> You need to have restarted RStudio at least once since the Rmdx
> installation.

If you are working outside of RStudio or the desired file has already
been created, you just need to set the output in the yaml to be Rmdx:
rmdx\_html.

``` yaml
---
title: "Template Title"
author: "Daniel E. de la Rosa"
date: "November 11, 2020"
output: 
  Rmdx::rmdx_html:
    footer_name: 'Daniel E. de la Rosa'
    
toc-title: 'Contents'
fig_caption: true
bibliography: 'bibliography.bib' 
nocite: '@*' 
---
```

## Roadmap

Rmdx is an early stage and have a not clear scope. Likewise, Rmdx will
be useful to me with some elements of another package that is in
development. These are some of the ideas that at the moment I plan to
add to the package. Feel free to propose any change that you consider
pertinent. Look at `Contributing` below to see how.

1.  Make
    [rmdx\_docx](https://drdsdaniel.github.io/Rmdx/reference/rmdx_docx.html)
    full compatible with
    [rdox\_document](https://github.com/davidgohel/officedown/blob/master/R/rdocx_document.R)

2.  Make a version of
    [rmdx\_html](https://drdsdaniel.github.io/Rmdx/reference/rmdx_html.html)
    with float toc in the rmdx style

3.  Add Spanish language support for some of the rmdx functions

4.  Lots of changes to the
    [rmdx\_pdf](https://drdsdaniel.github.io/Rmdx/reference/rmdx_pdf.html)
    format. To be notified on the fly.
